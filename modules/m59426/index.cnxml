  <md:title>Java362 Getting Started with the PictureExplorer Class</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Learn about a picture explorer class that allows you to determine the numeric color values for any pixel in a picture by placing a cursor on the pixel.  The pixel position is controlled by clicking or dragging the mouse within the picture, clicking buttons, or typing coordinate values.  You can also zoom in and out to view the pixel in more or less detail, and you can see the actual color of the pixel in a large square.</md:abstract>

Over the years, I have published a large number of tutorials in the areas of computer programming and 
	digital signal processing (DSP). As I have time available, I am converting the more significant of those tutorials into cnxml code and re-publishing them at

This tutorial may contain internal links to other tutorials that I have

good. In any event, if you search
